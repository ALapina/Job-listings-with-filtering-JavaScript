**WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!!!!**

Live: https://alapina.github.io/Job-listings-with-filtering-JavaScript

‚úÖ DONE:

- Accessible HTML
- CSS Tailwind (‚ù§Ô∏è loved it so much!)
- JS adding and removing elements from filter panel and filter state

‚öí TODO:

- Complete JS part - render offers based on selected state
- Testing with Cypress, also CI with Cypress would be good https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/continuous-integration.html#Setting-up-CI
- Unit testing?
- Maybe put data on firebase and make api requests, just for practise?
